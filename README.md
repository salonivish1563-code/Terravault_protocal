TerraVault Protocol

## 📘 Project Description
TerraVault Protocol is a simple on-chain vault mechanism that allows users to deposit and withdraw native blockchain currency. All funds are securely tracked using smart contract logic, providing transparency and self-custody without relying on centralized systems.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a secure, transparent, and user-driven decentralized vault protocol that empowers individuals to store and manage their digital value safely.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Deposit & Withdraw:** Users can deposit and withdraw native tokens freely and securely.  
- **Event Logging:** Every deposit and withdrawal is logged for full transparency.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Multi-asset vault support (ERC-20, ERC-721).  
- Time-locked vaults or staking features.  
- DAO-based governance for protocol upgrades.  
- Layer-2 compatibility and gas-optimized implementations.  
- Web3 frontend dashboard for user interaction.
